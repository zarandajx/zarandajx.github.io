  An introduction...
</p>
<!--more-->

<p>
  My name is Areli. Areli means the <q>voice of God</q>or <q>the light or vision of God</q>, according to various sources I found through Google. If these sources are in any way reputable, I am in danger.

<p>
  Like I said yesterday I was born in 1999 which chronologically means that I'm 19 years old, even though I feel a lot older...
</p>

<p>
  Some things I'd like to do in the near future are: learn how to write computer software and score a movie. I'm teaching myself french and guitar, just because I think they're interesting. <!--Usually, I write prodigiously in my journal and such, but lately I've lost the desire to. I can still write, but I just don't seem to get any pleasure out of it...-->
</p>

<p>
  I'm creating this site to work through rough ideas and post drafts (I think this space lends itself beautifully to incubating ideas), but I also want to post things that are about my personal life, just to be able to look back on all of it.
