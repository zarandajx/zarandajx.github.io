  I'm probably not the first to write a dramaturgical analysis of social media, but I am the first Gen Z-er

  I've been reading a lot about dramaturgy these past couple of days, and it's very interesting. Dramaturgy is a sociological perspective introduced by Ervin Goffman in his 1959 book <i>The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life</i>. In essence, dramaturgy appropriates theatrical terms in order to describe social interactions.
</p>

<p>
  One of the interesting ideas of dramaturgical sociology is that, in day-to-day life, people are actors performing in front of an audience. Just like actors we rehearse our roles in order to create specific impressions in the minds of our audience (in dramaturgy this is called <q>impression management</q>).
</p>

<p>
  In dramaturgical sociology everyone has a 'self', this is 'who you are'. Through your performance your goal is to be accepted by the audience for who you are. If you are successful, you'll be seen by the audience in the way you want to be seen.

<p>
  The charm of social media is that it's a highly curated version of yourself and yet it's impossible to manage impressions on it because you don't know who your audience is. Even though we may think that impression management would be easier on social media it's actually pretty volatile.
</p>

<p>
  When I think of my generation, young people who have been on social media all throughout their formatives years, I wonder what effect this has. I have noticed that there is little to no nuance in interactions on social media. You don't know who your audience is and since their is such a wide variety of social media users you cannot possibly manage impressions--- the same performance that is lauded by one audience offends another. So where does that leave people? I'll save that analysis for another day...
</p>

<p>
  <span class="hL">Basically, we can't manage impressions online in the way we do in real life, and we can't successfully present our selves on social media.</span>
</p>

<p>
  I just started reading about dramaturgy so I'm still learning the theory. I think it's a good framework to use when thinking about social media, and I'll definitely have to write a follow up.<br>
