  I changed the site a little over the weekend...
</p>
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/digitalAttic.gif"  class="postImg"/>

<p>
  I felt it was important to document the way the site changes, so I'm keeping a running track of it. Overtime I hope to see how I and this site improve.
</p>

<p>
  First I added an archive:
</p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/digitalAttic1.gif"  class="postImg"/>
<p>
  I felt like this was really neccessary because I don't want my posts to get lost and I need some way to view them. I still have to tweak the spacing though.
</p>

<p>
  Then, I used Bootstrap's Carousel plugin to create a slideshow:
</p>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/digitalAttic2.gif"  class="postImg"/>
<p>
  I've seen some sites with this feature and I thought it'd be really neat to feature on this site even though I don't have that many images yet. The images load really slowly, for whatever reason, so I still have to fix that as well.
</p>

<p>
  I built this blog from scratch and I'm very proud of it, but there's still a lot for me to learn and improve upon.
</p>

<p>
  I'm starting to see this site as an extension of my mind and in the words of Rahel Jaeggi, my attempts at successfully "appropriating the world" or as Susan Sontag once did, "eating the world"
</p>

<p>
  I'll probably be away for awhile, but I promise I'll be back soon.<br/>
