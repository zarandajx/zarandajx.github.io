  Day of the Dead is a computer sale at my school. I've been really excited about it for a while and it didn't disappoint. I only paid $10 for a computer and $10 for peripheries.

  Originally I wanted to buy a laptop with a CD/DVD drive but by the time I got there, they were all gone.

  I ended up buying a Dell OptiPlex GX620 desktop. I downloaded Ubuntu onto it because I already had it on a flashdrive. It's got a CD/DVD drive and a 4GB RAM. I'm still getting it set up but I'm really excited to finally have a CD/DVD drive.

  I also bought a Casio CTK-411. I was really eyeing this; I even emailed the IT department so they would set it aside.

  I don't know how to play keyboard but I've always wanted to learn, and since I want to score movies one day, I think it's definitely time to start practicing.

  Happy Day of the Dead!</br>
