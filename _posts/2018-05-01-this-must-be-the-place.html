<p>This blog is sort of like a <i>digital attic.</i></p>
<!--more-->
<p>I was born in 1999. I'm part of that lovable, digital native generation everyone a decade older than us hates. I think we're quite charming, putting our entire lives online for the world to see. </p>

<p>Personally, I've always been averse to posting things on social media but, I consume it incessantly. I find myself thinking in terms of tumblr posts, gifs, memes, tweets, vines. It's because social media is ineluctable in the digital native's milieu.
</p>

<p>I don't neccesarily want to use social media more effectively (actually what I'd really like to do is not use it at all) but I do want to take control of my digital self, because while I don't like it I understand how important all of this is. I want to have a centralized place to put all of my rough drafts, rough thoughts, and digital artifacts. So that's what this place is, somewhere to stick things when I don't know where else to stick them.</p>

<p>This is the place. Thanks for making the journey out here. </p>
